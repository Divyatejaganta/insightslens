Convert chaos into clarity: ingest logs, detect anomalies, cluster incidents, and get LLM summaries.

Tagline: “Convert chaos into clarity — one log file at a time.”

Stack: Python · OpenAI API · LangChain · FastAPI · Streamlit

Concept:
An LLM-driven observability tool that ingests application or server logs, clusters incidents, and generates intelligent summaries, anomaly trends, and root-cause hypotheses using embeddings and GPT reasoning.

Why it’s awesome:
	•	Real-world DevOps/Support use case (high employer relevance).
	•	Integrates NLP + anomaly detection.
	•	Deployable locally with Streamlit and Qdrant/OpenSearch.
